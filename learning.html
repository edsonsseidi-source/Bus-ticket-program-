<h2>Overall Reflection</h2>
        <p>
            Completing these CPD activities has helped me build confidence in Python, Linux, Git, and core cybersecurity concepts. 
            By regularly practising and revisiting topics, I have seen clear progress in how I approach problems and learn new tools.
            I have also realised how important continuous learning is in this field, as technology and threats are always changing.
            These experiences have strengthened my interest in cybersecurity and confirmed my goal of working in a role such as a
            Junior Security Analyst or SOC Analyst in the future.
