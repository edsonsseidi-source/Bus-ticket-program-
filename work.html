        <h3>Project 1: Bus Ticket Program (Python)</h3>
        <p><strong>What I built:</strong> I created a Python program using IDLE that allows a user to select a bus destination, calculate ticket prices, and display the final cost. The program includes user input, simple validation, and basic calculations.</p>
        <p><strong>Tools & Technologies:</strong> Python, IDLE, variables, functions, loops, conditionals.</p>
        <p><strong>Skills demonstrated:</strong> Problem-solving, structuring a small program, handling user input, and applying core Python concepts.</p>
        <p><strong>What I learned:</strong> How to design a simple program flow, process user input, work with calculations, and debug small errors in my code. This project helped me gain confidence using Python in a practical context.</p>

        <h3>Project 2: Linux Command Practice</h3>
        <p><strong>What I did:</strong> I practised basic Linux commands using a terminal to understand how operating systems work behind the scenes. I used commands to navigate folders, list files, check permissions, and create or delete directories.</p>
        <p><strong>Tools & Technologies:</strong> Linux terminal (or Windows Subsystem for Linux).</p>
        <p><strong>Skills demonstrated:</strong> Command-line navigation, understanding file and directory structure, and basic file permission awareness.</p>
        <p><strong>What I learned:</strong> How to move between directories, create and manage files, and why Linux is widely used in cybersecurity for tasks such as scripting, security tools, and server management.</p>

        <h3>Project 3: Cybersecurity Awareness Poster / Guide</h3>
        <p><strong>What I did:</strong> I created a digital poster/guide explaining common cybersecurity threats such as phishing, malware, weak passwords, and how to stay safe online. I used course material and beginner-friendly online resources to research the topics.</p>
        <p><strong>Tools & Technologies:</strong> Google Docs / Word / Canva, online articles and videos.</p>
        <p><strong>Skills demonstrated:</strong> Researching cybersecurity topics, summarising technical information in simple language, and presenting it in a clear, visual format.</p>
        <p><strong>What I learned:</strong> How to identify phishing signs, why strong passwords and multi-factor authentication are important, and how to explain cybersecurity concepts to non-technical audiences.</p>
