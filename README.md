Bus Ticket Program

This repository contains my Python coursework project created as part of my first-year studies in Cyber Security at Nottingham Trent University. The program allows a user to view ticket information, calculate costs, and manage simple bus ticket data using Python and CSV files.

Project Overview

The Bus Ticket Program is a beginner-level Python project designed to help me practise reading data from CSV files, writing basic Python code, structuring a simple program, handling user input, and using functions and basic program logic.

The program loads ticket data from a CSV file, allows the user to view available ticket options, and calculates totals based on user selections.

Features

The program loads ticket data from CSV files.
It displays available tickets to the user.
The user selects a destination or ticket type.
The program calculates and displays the final cost.
Basic error handling is included.
The program follows a clear and logical flow.

Files in this repository

main.py is the main Python program.
tickets.csv contains the ticket data used by the program.
purchases.csv contains example output data from test runs.
README.md is the documentation file.

Tools and Technologies Used

Python 3 using the IDLE environment.
CSV files for storing and loading data.
Basic functions, loops, and conditional statements.

Skills Demonstrated

Problem-solving and logical thinking.
Program design and structure.
Working with external data files.
Using functions and variables effectively.
Handling basic user interaction.

What I Learned

I learned how to read and process data from CSV files.
I learned how to structure a small Python program logically.
I improved my understanding of user input and validation.
I developed confidence debugging logical errors.
I learned how to present program output clearly.

How to Run the Program

First, install Python from the official Python website.
Next, download this repository using the Code button and selecting Download ZIP.
Finally, open the program in IDLE or a terminal and run the file using the command:

python main.py

Coursework Context

This project forms part of my Skills Portfolio for Academic and Professional Development. It demonstrates my early programming skills, my understanding of basic data handling, and my ability to document my work clearly and professionally.COCCCCCCCCCC
