    <h2>Personal Profile</h2>
<p>My name is Edson and I am a first-year Cyber Security student at Nottingham Trent University. I enjoy learning how technology works, exploring cybersecurity concepts, and improving my programming skills through hands-on practice.</p>

<p>I am motivated by understanding how systems can be protected from online threats and how security tools are used in real-world environments. I enjoy solving problems, analysing issues, and learning new tools independently. My strengths include reliability, curiosity, and a willingness to improve — qualities that help me perform well in both academic and practical work.</p>

<p>I believe I would be a strong fit for a future role because I learn quickly, communicate clearly, and enjoy working with others. Through my projects, such as developing a Python Bus Ticket Program, practising Linux command-line skills, and creating a cybersecurity awareness guide, I have shown that I can do the job and am committed to developing professionally.</p>

<p>My long-term goal is to work in cybersecurity, possibly as a Junior Security Analyst or SOC Analyst. I am driven by the idea of protecting important systems, continuously improving my skills, and bringing a positive, hard-working attitude to any team I join.</p>
